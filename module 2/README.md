# Game Playing Agent: ISOLATION

![1](https://github.com/shauryabit2k18/udacity_artificial_intelligence/blob/master/module%202/1.gif)

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a game playing agent to play a game using adversarial search methods. The goal is to create a game playing agent that defeats our opponent at a game of isolation consistently. For this project Iâ€™ve designed three heuristics to create an effective edge for the game playing agent. 

## MinMax:

In the case of the game isolation, there are two players competing against each other. We are under the assumption that the AI player and human player are both playing two win. While back-propagating through the search tree, our algorithm must maximize the outcome (choose the optimal move) for when itâ€™s the AIâ€™s turn and minimize the outcome (choose the least optimal move for us) when itâ€™s the human playerâ€™s turn.

Observe the bottom-left portion of the search tree â€” the bottom nodes are maximizing nodes. Maximizing nodes select the highest value (most optimal outcome). As you may guess, minimizing nodes select the lowest value (least optimal outcome). Imagine that you are playing a game of chess, each move you make is a maximizing node (your intention is to win) â€” and every move your opponent makes is a minimizing node (move that messes up your game ðŸ˜ž).
